#bss=wlan1_0

# (new feature)
# By default, MANA will behave the same for all SSIDs. Enabling this filter will

# EAP Relay with Sycophant
# it’s possible to relay inner MSCHAPv2 to get connected to PEAP networks without having to crack the credentials.
# This attack requires an appropriately configured hostapd-mana and the wpa_sycophant tool.
# To enable this attack, you need the following config options enabled/set
#enable_sycophant=1
#sycophant_dir=/tmp/

# WPA Handshake capturing!
# WARNING, YOU HAVE TO DISABLE MANA WHILE USING THIS!
# THEY WILL NOT WORK TOGETHER!
# Mana can capture handshakes and write them to a file, ready to be cracked in hashcat (hccapx) format.
# You can enable this with the following config option
#mana_wpaout=/tmp/hostapd.hccapx
