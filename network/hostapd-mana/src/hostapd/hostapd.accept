# List of MAC addresses that are allowed to authenticate (IEEE 802.11)
# with the AP. Optional VLAN ID can be assigned for clients based on the
# MAC address if dynamic VLANs (hostapd.conf dynamic_vlan option) are used.
# A MAC mask can be used to specify a range of MAC addresses. However
# this is only useful with mana_macacl and ignored by normal macaddr_acl
# behaviour.
# For example:
# 00:11:22:33:44:55		00:ff:00:ff:00:ff
# will be similar to saying allow all MAC addresses that match: *:11:*:33:*:55
# Locally administered MACs (i.e. the random MACs) used by some device to probe
# for networks are handled by the below MAC and mask. It's essentially checking
# for the second bit having been set in the MAC i.e. ??????1?:*:*:*:*:*
